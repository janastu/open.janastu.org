#### I am an anti-disciplinary designer/artist/researcher exploring our relationship with emergent media technology, both as its users and makers; The future they might bring, and how they can become more accessible & equitable. 

My work and research looks at technology as a tool for both control and liberation.\
In my practice as a designer-maker I use creative-technology and Interactive media to Inquire how to use technology to express, create and create new tools.\
\
As an Artist and researcher I critically examine the issues with distribution of technology, power structures and its socio-political impact, through speculative & academic writings.\
I have been trained in Exhibition Design and Interactive Media Design. I have not been trained in cooking but I can be found in the kitchen quite often.

# Mani Kantan

An aspiring designer currently studying UX design in [IxDF,](https://www.interaction-design.org/mani-kantan) I discovered UX/UI design after working for years with Janastu and knowing I needed a change. I wanted to create beautiful products and make others actually feel something when they interacted with them. 

Thoroughly fond of painting and reading, I often spend my free time doodling, curled up with a book, or looking up design related articles online. You can find my works here. [https://manikantan.co.in](https://manikantan.co.in)

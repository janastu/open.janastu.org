I'm an gardener-in-training, learning to be nurturing to beings, things, spaces, dreams and collectives. I enjoy tinkering with ideas and tools and enjoy ideas that lead to tools and tools that lead to ideas. Learning to explore ways of making, living, being and caring. 

I illustrate, write, connect and organize, mostly at the same time. I'd like to be present, learning and active everywhere I can.  I research care, collectives, alternate futures, hope, liberation, dissent, anti-cynicing and new ways of being.

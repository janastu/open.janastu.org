# Joel Louzado

Joel is a Product Engineer with 8 years of experience across Automotive-Infotainment, Enterprise Software, Fantasy Sports and Education. Joel is interested in working with teams big and small to bring visibility to the entire software development process, so everyone on a team can be involved in bringing their projects to life. 

This is important because not only can Software Engineering be a really opaque, jargon-heavy discipline, it's also a relatively young field that's still working out the best way to deal with the inherent complexity of explaining abstract concepts to a computer in terms it understands.

When he's not in front of a screen Joel enjoys Reading, Yoga and Slacklining and chilling with an ice-cold beer.

# Sanketh Kumar

For the last few years, Sankethâ€™s work has involved using his background in engineering for sustainable and environment-friendly solutions for programmes for rural livelihood generation. Working with Gram Seva Sangh \(rural producers collective\) and Mitan \(handicrafts\) introduced him to the world of handicrafts and the culture and philosophy of hand-making. Through his work with Janastu, he has tried to focus on setting up spaces for handicraft and for artisans, rural youth, and urban designer-engineers to come, collaborate and co-create. He has worked on several projects that have tried to integrate elements of DIY-culture and self-directed learning with local and indigenous culture and knowledge.

# Upasana

Upasana is an interdisciplinary researcher working on digital labour and cyberculture. She holds a Masters in Development Studies from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. At Janastu, she helps with writing and research. When not sitting in front of screens, she enjoys making a mess in the kitchen, figuring out what does not work more often than figuring out what does.

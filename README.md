## **Janastu is a people oriented open-source collective working to enable community storytelling by the people, for the people.**&#x20;

Our mission is to build decentralized community owned networks to provision local connectivity in remote areas and to facilitate Internet, technology and crafts literacy.&#x20;

We are developing audio annotation tools for community archiving and to help construct storytelling narratives to help in the inclusion of low-semi literates as first class internet citizens.

# Anthillhacks 21.22

## **About**

![](../.gitbook/assets/Anthillhacks21.21.jpg)

## **T**ogether Being Apart

We want to experiment with cooking and hacking together - offline with online participants - as a way to maybe connect sideways and informally in these times of fatiguing online sessions.

Our theme is to _"**Cook together and hack together, being apart**"_ within the WiFi mesh network that has been set up in 4 villages at the Devarayanadurga hills and the valley of Halekote (https://iruway.janastu.org/), Durgadahalli and Thimmanayakanahalli. We intend to connect these to the Internet world and friends who would like to join in some of these sessions.

We intend to have parallel cooking of the same recipe (adapted to location of the parallelly cooking participants) in different villages of anthill area (https://open.janastu.org/projects/cowmesh) where some are likely to join in from outside - India and elsewhere.

A similar process / pattern we hope will be used for other tech and non-tech activities you all bring into the event.

### Dates: Dec 23rd to Jan 4th <a href="#dates-dec-23rd-to-jan-4th" id="dates-dec-23rd-to-jan-4th"></a>

_Sessions and activities from **Dec 24th to Jan 3rd** (9 days including the 2 weekends of Dec 24th and Jan 1st)_

### Theme: Cook and Hack days <a href="#theme-cook-and-hack-days" id="theme-cook-and-hack-days"></a>

**Everyday session tracks**

1. Wireless mesh networking, nodes/devices and services
2. Crafts and Maker Space
3. Learning and local content, tools and management
4. Farming, trekking and performances on the rocks

### Volunteer, participate and ideate <a href="#volunteer-participate-and-ideate" id="volunteer-participate-and-ideate"></a>

Our team is listening and looking forward to include you and your session and activities including outdoor ones like trekking and sessions on the beautiful rocks around (weather permitting). Please email us at [anthillhacks@janastu.org](mailto:anthillhacks@janastu.org)

**Pre-announced Parallel cooking sessions** of the same “**recipe**” (adapted to location of the parallelly cooking participants) in different villages of DDHills COWmesh area where some are likely to join in from outside - india and elsewhere. A similar process/pattern we hope will be used for other tech and nontech activities you all bring in to the event.

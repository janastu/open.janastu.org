## **About**

![](../.gitbook/assets/Anthillhacks21.21.jpg)

## **T**ogether Being Apart



Our theme is to **Cook together being apart** and **hack together being apart** with in the wifi mesh network area.

Come join us in the beautiful hills near Devarayanadurga, Tumkur where we want to camp, cook and hack together. In the pristine Iruway farm over the course of 10 days, we will be exploring life and sciences in many forms. From learning and practicing sustainable farming practices to learning about building a localised health infrastructure, from Cooking Online and Offline together with our friends and neighbours exploring local recipes to learning about knowledge tools and craft practices from a hyperlocal lens - this is an unparalleled experience spanning from the 24th December 2021 to the 3rd of Jan 2022.

Over the course of AnthillHacks 21.22, we will be exploring different tracks through practice as well as working sessions in collaboration with local participants. These tracks seek to explore a few large questions in small yet meaningful ways

### Dates: Dec 23rd to Jan 4th <a href="#dates-dec-23rd-to-jan-4th" id="dates-dec-23rd-to-jan-4th"></a>

Sessions and activities from **Dec 24th to Jan 3rd** (9 days including the 2 weekends of Dec 24th and Jan 1st)

### Theme: Cook and Hack days <a href="#theme-cook-and-hack-days" id="theme-cook-and-hack-days"></a>

**Everyday session tracks**

1. Wireless mesh networking, nodes/devices and services
2. Crafts and Maker Space
3. Learning and local content, tools and management
4. Farming, trekking and performances on the rocks
5. Cooking - we want to try if cooking together offline with online participants maybe be a way to connect sideways and informally in these times of fatiguing online sessions.

### Location : near Bangalore, India <a href="#location-near-bangalore-india" id="location-near-bangalore-india"></a>

Our wifi mesh network area is about 70km from Bangalore, setup in 4 villages - at the **Devarayanadurga hills** and the valley of Halekote, Durgadahalli and Thimmanayakanahalli. We intend to also connect sessions to our friends outside the mesh area based on nature of activity and interest.

### Volunteer, participate and ideate <a href="#volunteer-participate-and-ideate" id="volunteer-participate-and-ideate"></a>

**Please register on this** [**link**](https://nextcloud.livinglabs.network/apps/forms/xk4JEemKJ5M68NYj)**. Registration is free and helps us plan the event.**

We are looking for documenters and translators for each of the 5 locations in the mesh area.

**Pre-announced parallel cooking sessions** of the same “**recipe**” (adapted to location of the parallelly cooking participants) in different villages of ddhills COWmesh area where some are likely to join in from outside - india and elsewhere. A similar process/pattern we hope will be used for other tech and nontech activities you all bring in to the event.

### Food & Accommodation: <a href="#food-amp-accommodation" id="food-amp-accommodation"></a>

There are a couple of rooms in nearby Yatri nivas - a travellers lodge, and other smaller “guest houses” built by the devotees of the temple on the hill in case of larger groups visiting we would like to know a bit earlier to coordinate the logistics. You are welcome to pitch your own tent. We have some tents that can be allotted on a first come basis. One meal a day is planned to be cooked by the participants on a pre-decided recipe, this activity will also be streamed so people online can also be part of the cooking and we are having some local cooks to prepare the other meals.

_**P.S:** Guest house on the hill will be 4km away by 2 wheelers, 12 km by 4 wheelers and 1.5 km by foot from the iruWay farm. Will be closed on 31st and 1st._

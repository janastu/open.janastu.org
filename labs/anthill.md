## Planning Anthillhacks 2022 - 2023?

**Anthillhacks 2022 - 2023?**

Starting **Dec 15th** we begin the build activities and invite friends and community to help.

We expect the event activities to start by the weekend after which is the 17th and 18th of December. We expect it to go on until the end of the year and into the new year but most activities to peak before the 24th (Saturday)

STORIES

```
- everyday some stories and films
```

GENDER

```
- everyday on gender and inclusion
```

FOOD

```
- everyday different nodes
```

The event will be distributed in the COWMesh area but the iruWay campus will have the main gathering with accommodation in and around the campus.

We invite organizations to announce days of their convenience and we hope to help build the activities around them.

**build days** - nodes setup with ASPi, mesh extended with additional nodes including test setups - spaces for activities - distributed and CN contexts - COWLanding page setup - people roles and responsibilities. **There are plans to setup multiple LR mesh networks services and dWeb demos.**

**Topics of interest suggested for:**

gender days, libre router (LR) and antennas, community networks and services, cowlanding and applications, voice communications and media archiving, annotations and renarration, dWeb and Community Networks, e-vehicles and rural design, organic and permaculture, internet independence and education, heritage and biodiverity narratives (ethno botanical practices), crafts and arts, data rituals (30% of economy; creating markets by formalising the informal economy), resource mapping exercises, follow the sheep and other map story telling, sustainable structures, open space events, makerspaces, creative community displays, hikes treks and bouldering, .. **creative music and large puppets  (friends of Agnii - Art for All)**

Again at the beautiful **hills near Devarayanadurga, Tumkur** where we want to camp, cook and hack together. In the pristine Iruway farm over the course of 15 days, and we are open to ideas of making this event more distributed.

Be a collaborator! Cocreator and Theme or session developer.

### Location : near Bangalore, India <a href="#location-near-bangalore-india" id="location-near-bangalore-india"></a>

Our wifi mesh network area is about 70km from Bangalore, setup in 4 villages - at the **Devarayanadurga hills** and the valley of Halekote, Durgadahalli and Thimmanayakanahalli. We intend to also connect sessions to our friends outside the mesh area based on nature of activity and interest.

# IruWay Farm

&#x20;`IruWay Rural Research Lab` `DD Hills`  `Events`

[IruWay](https://iruway.janastu.org) is a collectively owned farm that aspires to be an inclusive laboratory of holistic technology exploration. Iruway is a farm located at the foothills of Devarayandurga near Durgadahalli village in Tumakuru district. Iruway is inside Halekote, and is close to forests and hills.

Iruway, or “iruve” means ants in kannada. As “iruve” becomes Iruway, we take inspiration from ants, as creatures of cooperation, coordination and the collective. Iruway was built with this concept, to foster a sustainable alternative for local knowledge creation and creativity.

### **Anthillhacks and Annotated Knowledge Archives**

The transformative potential of indigenous knowledge production, archiving and storytelling in a decentralized wifi-mesh context is likely going to lead to alternate possibilities of development for low-literate and remote communities.

# BaaApp

BaaApp Android app that simplifies track-based content contribution by shepherds and has led the [Follow the Sheep](http://mitan.in/followsheep) project.\
This work comprises of BaaApp app (janastu.org/apps/baaapp) which allows to track, record waypoints interactively on the map with photo, text-note or voice recordings. Then can then be uploaded to a common server where they can be studied by researchers/NGOs who can help negotiate for CPR and nomadic mobility rights including BCP formulation and land range observations. IIIT Hyderabad Socionity project has also used it to study app utilisation and to help develop complimentary applications. We use OSM data and OSMtracker app to configure/develop this app and related services. With features like GPX file export, mule-assisted media uploads, and detailed configuration settings, BaaApp empowers users to efficiently manage and share their tracking data.

# Raagi Gudda Slum Project

We intend to work with the Ragi Gudda Slum in Bangalore, which became a vertical housing settlement project for state rehabilitation of slum dwellers in 2011-2012. People lack access to formal credit, job mobility, education and healthcare. Our vision is to create an open-source eco-system of connectivity for them that makes their needs accessible. We will begin by setting up a wifi mesh network in the area. Several households have been enthusiastic about working towards such connectivity infrastructure. The problems of connectivity, although present long before the pandemic, were amplified because of it. Education and work that was available before cannot be accessed anymore because of the lack of networks and devices. Through this project, we hope to build a resilient connectivity infrastructure for the communities in the Ragi Gudda slums using mesh routers and community radio facilities.

&#x20;Through this project, we would also like to work on a holistic approach to learning, capacity building and community cultural interventions. We have been working with youth and women in the area and introducing WiFi mesh operations, local repository of their content, open box devices and open source technology by starting tech-circles. Our objective is to see such a culturally compex community succeed in innovating and customising infrasture based on their evolving needs.

### Mission

We work with the Raagi Gudda Slum in Bengaluru - a high-rise housing settlement project for state rehabilitation of slum dwellers built in 2011-2012. The people lack access to formal credit, job mobility, education and healthcare. Our vision is to create an open-source eco-system of connectivity for them that makes their needs accessible.

### Vision

We will begin by setting up a wifi mesh network in the region. Several households have been enthusiastic about working towards such connectivity infrastructure. The problems of connectivity, although present long before the pandemic, were amplified because of it. Education and work that was available before cannot be accessed anymore because of the lack of networks and devices. Through this project, we hope to build a resilient connectivity infrastructure for the communities in the Raagi Gudda slums using mesh routers and community radio facilities.

### Solution

Through this project, we would also like to work on training the women and youth in the region in open source technology by starting tech-circles and GLUGs (GNU/Linux User Groups) so that the communities are not only able to maintain open-source infrastructure themselves, but also succeed in innovating and customising this open-source infrastructure based on their evolving needs.

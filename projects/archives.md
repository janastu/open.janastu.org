# Archival Projects

![](../../.gitbook/assets/da.png)

The transformative potential of indigenous knowledge production, archiving and storytelling in a decentralized wifi-mesh context is likely going to lead to alternate possibilities of development for low-literate and remote communities.

Our interest is to look at both archival architectures and how they connect to the offline as well as the process of data creation, interpretation and analysis as an essentially offline activity. It reflects on data creation for an archive and the interpretative and organisational logics that determines inclusion. It also comments on institutional structures and procedures as essential drivers of the life of a digital archive with resources and institutional politics playing an important role in the nature, use and access of the archive.

Once the archive comes into being various elements in the architecture of the archive itself enable a selective engagement with the offline propelled by the archive’s politics. This can manifest in metadata derivation, access, dissemination, assigned user roles and hierarchies and the archive’s approach to validation and annotation.

Access to the archive then invites questions of use and performance. Who chooses to see what in what context? How does the access that the archive enable direct this performance? Communally annotated archives reflect social processes that may be independent of the original archival impulse and generate new data and open new archival pathways.
